Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation
 - Fully convolutional networks (FCN) have demonstrated effectiveness in performing semantic segmentation.
 
Semantic image segmentation with deep convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral filtering
 - Chen used dilated convolutions to enlarge the -receptive field of the network while retaining dense prediction.
- conditional random fiels (CRFs) have been applied as post-porcessing or have been intergrated into the network to refine boundary of prediction

Predicting depth surface normals and semantic labels with a common multi-scale convolutional architecture
- in [7] the depth image is simply treated as a noe-channel image.
- Eigen et al. proposed a global-to-local strategy to combine different levels of prediction, which simply extracted feature is again concatenated with the image one for prediction.
