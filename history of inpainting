 patch-based image synthesis Barnes et al 
 -(Barabi et al 2012,  huang et al. 2014, simakov et al. 2008, wexler et al. 2007)
 - it remains a chllenging problem because if often requires high-level recognition of scens.

Context encoders: feature learning by inpainting CVPR 2016
-context-encoder
-applied addversarial training	
- although the CE had shown promising results, inadequate representation gereneration skill of an auto encoder network in the CE led to substantial amount of impluasible results as well


High-resolution inmage inpainting using multi-scale neural patch synthesis
-ce-like network is trained with an adversarial and a euclidean loss to obtain the global structure of the input, then the style transfer method used

Combining markov random fields and convolutional neural networks for image synthesis CVPR

perceptural losses for real-time style transfer and super-resolution (springer international publishing cam, 604`711)
-the generative resnet that we(PGGAN authors) compose consists of down-sampling, resifual blocks and up-sampling parts using the architectural guidedlines introduces in this book


deconvolution and ceckerboard artifacts 
-using interpolated convolution to overcome the well-known checkerboard artifacts during the up-sampling operation caused by the transposed convolution.


High-resolution image inpainting using multi-scale neural patch synthesis
-NPS approach take several second due to theur local texture constraint

Semantic image inpainting with deep generative models.  CVPR
- importance-weighted context loss that considers closeness to the corrupted region is utilized

Generative face completion CVPR
Globally and Locally Consistent Image completion  [ACM transactions on Graphics]
-add a new discriminator network that considers only the filled region to emphasize the adversarial loss on top of the global GAN discriminator (G-GAN)
-although those works have shown prominent results for the large hole filling problem, their main drawback is the LGAN's smphasis on conditioning to the location of the mask.
-( sloved by applying post-processing methods to the systhesized image)
-LGAN pyches the generative network to produce independent textures that are incompatible with the whole image semantics.
-(this problem is solved by adding an extension network that corrects the imperfections)

Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion [ACM Transactions on Graphis] again
- first using dilate convolution for image inpainting
